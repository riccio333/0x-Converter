# 0x Converter
This converter can convert string values like:
- Text
- Binary
- Hex
- Ascii
- Base64
- Octal
//screen dello start del programma
## The program
I made some checkboxes in the converter to make things easier. So if someone wants the binary string with spaces he can select the "with spaces" checkbox and copy the value.

For long strings obviously the program can't display all the text on the label, so you can copy the values and paste them somewhere. I also made a "copy all" button that copy all values so when you paste the values will be displayed like this:

## Bugs
I worked a lot on this project *(and sometimes I closed the project for some days because it was too boring to code and full of bugs)* and I'm an uman, so I can also do some mistakes. If you found any bugs contact me please and tell me about the bug that you found and also send some screenshots or video. (https://riccio333.space/contacts)

*p.s.: I'm not <u>100% sure</u> that conversion from <u>ASCII or base64</u> to others values **are right.** For example I converted  If you have any suggestions to fix the code to convert from this values to others they are welcome.*

## Using my code
If you need some parts of my code to put in your project **you can do it**, but if you need then to **publish** your program/project to GitHub or any other site **remember to put a comment with my repository link** ( //https://github.com/riccio333/0x-converter ) for respect of who made the code and who is watching your code, so in case they can't understand something they can also watch my repository (this also applies to any other people on GitHub). **Thank you.**
